# Docker fun

Generally, this assumes you have cloned the top level repo into ~/bin.

* update-usr-local-bin.sh: Copy script files into /usr/local/bin/.
* dockupdate <name>: Download a new image, then terminate the existing Docker container and relaunch it. Accidentally handles partial matching for 'plexinc/pms-docker' vs. linuxserver.io-based containers.
* docker-<service>.sh: Launch relevant container. Contains my personal mounts for various Drobo appliances.
