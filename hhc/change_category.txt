-- This series of commands is intended to update a given category for a particular brand/pattern combination.

-- First, get all the categories in the system:

select tid, name from term_data where vid = 7 order by name;

-- Then get the offending category based on the brand/pattern

select * from hhc_product_full_categories where pattern in ('Atlas', 'Sahara') and brand = 'Nachtmann';

-- Once you have the category to replace (eg 1384 --> 1389 for Glassware to Home Decor),
-- update term_node with the vids in question.

\T /tmp/out.txt
select vid from hhc_product_full_categories where pattern in ('Atlas', 'Sahara') and brand = 'Nachtmann' and category_term_id = 1384;
\! sqlin /tmp/out.txt

-- Copy and paste the result from sqlin to the following query's IN condition:

update term_node set tid = 1389 where tid = 1384 and vid in ('00000', '00001', '00002');
